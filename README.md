## Motivation
In some so called robot restraunts, there exist the robot waiters/waitressed. However, these robots are basically "wheeled plate" that can only deliver the food instead of serving them. This project tries to design a robot arm that could maintain the balance of the plate, which then can be used to serve a drink without spilling.

## Tech/framework used
Arduino UNO, FreeRTOS, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Servo Motors, and Motion Tracking Algorithm.
